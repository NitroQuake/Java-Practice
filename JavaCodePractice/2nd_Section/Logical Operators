Logical operator is a symbol or word used to connect two or more expressions.

And expression:

int temperature = 22;
boolean isWarm = temperature > 20 && temperature < 30;
    //"boolean" create a boolean expression//
    //"&&" add this if you want an and operator to the boolean//
System.out.println(isWarm);
    //this code tells if the "temperature" is less than 20 and more than 30 through a boolean statement//

or and not expression:

boolean hasHighIncome = false;
boolean hasGoodCredit = true;
boolean hasCriminalRecord = false;
boolean isEligible = (hasHighIncome || hasGoodCredit) && !hasCriminalRecord;
    //"||" add this if you want an or operator to the boolean//
    //"!" checks if it's false//
System.out.println(isEligible);
    //this code is looking if "hasHighIncome" or "hasGoodCredit" has a true in it and that "hasCriminalReord" has a false//
