An if statement is a porgramming conditional statement that, if proved true, performs a function or displays information.

If statement:

int temp = 32;
if (temp > 30) {
    //"if" makes an if statement//
    //1st clause if "(temp > 30)" anything inside the 2 curly brackets below will be executed//
    System.out.println("It's a hot day");
    System.out.println("Drank water");
} 
else if (temp > 20) 
    //2nd clause if "(temp > 20)" is true anything below it will be executed//
    System.out.println("Beatiful day");
else 
    //3rd clause if none above are true anything below it will be executed//
    System.out.println("Cold day");
    //if one of the statement are true, all the code below it will be executed//

Simplifying If statements:

int income = 120000;
boolean hasHighIncome = (income > 100000);

Simplifying If statements with ternary operator when variable isn't boolean:

int income = 120000;
String className = income > 100000 ? "First" : "Economy";   
    //"?" is the ternary operator//
    //what this code does is, if the income is greater than 100000 the string will be changed to "First" if not it will change to "Economy"//

Switch statements, another way to do if statements:

String role = "admin"; 
switch (role) {
    case "admin":
        System.out.println("You're an admin");
        break;    
            //"break;" ends case//    
    case "moderator":
        System.out.println("You're a moderator");   
        break; 
            //"break;" ends case//  
    default:
        System.out.println("You're a guest");
}
