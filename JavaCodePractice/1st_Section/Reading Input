Reading input makes it so you can actually do something with the data being put in by the user.
Make sure to import the util.

Reading input (byte and double):

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    //"System.in" is used to input data in the terminal//
    //"System.out" is used to print something on the terminal//
System.out.print("Age: ");
    //"print" makes it not make a new line//
byte age = scanner.nextByte();
    //puts it in a byte(number only)//
    //"nextByte()" makes it so you need to input a byte for it to work//
    //"nextDouble()" makes it so you need to input a double for it to work//

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    //"System.in" is ued to input data in the terminal//
    //"System.out" is used to print something on the terminal//
System.out.print("Name: ");
    //"print" makes it not make a new line//
String name = scanner.nextLine().trim();
    //puts it in a string only//
    //"nextLine" allows it's so the computer registers multiple words//
    //".trim" deletes the spaces//
System.out.println("You are " + name);
