Formating Numbers:

String result = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance().format(1234567.891);
    //what is happening above is called method chaining, they use "." to seperate methods//
    //".getCurrencyInstance()" makes it have a dollar sign and commas between numbers//
    //".getPercentInstance()" makes it have a percentage sign and commas between numbers//
System.out.println(result);
    //these methods format a text, to make it have a dollar sign and commas between numbers//
