Varibales is a value that can chage, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program
Primative: numbers (int, byte, and long), characters (char), and booleans (boolean).
Reference: data and mail message
Primatives types are copied by their value.
Referances types are copied by the referances.

Examples:

Primative Types:

int age = 30;
    //int means integer//
    //"age" is the label of the variable//
    //sets the variable//
int temperature = 20; 
age = 35;
    //changes the variable//

int myAge = 30;
    //myAge set to 30//
int herAge = myAge;
    //herAge set to 30 because myAge = 30//

byte age = 30;
    //"byte" is same as integer but takes less space, up to 127//
long viewsCount = 3_123_456_789L;
    //we add an "L" to the end of it because the computer thinks it's a too big of an integer//
float price = 10.99F;
    //we add an "F" to the end of it because the computer thinks it's a double//
char letter = 'A'
boolean isEligible = false;

Reference Types:

byte age = 30;
Date now = new Date();
    //"new" is an operator that creates a reference//
System.out.println(now);
    //"System" is the class//
    //"out" is a field//

Point point1 = new Point(1, 1);
    //point1 holds the address, not the actual value//
Point point2 = point1;
    //point2 holds the same address as point1//
point1.x = 2;
    //update the value of x//
System.out.println(point2);
