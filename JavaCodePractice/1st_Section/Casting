Casting is a way of converting data from one data type to another data type.

Casting:

short x = 1;
int y = x + 2;
    //Above is an example of implicit casting, which means byte can be converted to short > int > long > float > double//

double x = 1.1;
double y = x + 2;
    //the "2" is converted into a double, when it's converted to a double it looks like this "2.0"//

double x = 1.1;
int y = (int)x + 2;
    //"1.1" is turned into an integer "1" by using "(int)"//

Unique Casting:

String x = "1";
int y = Integer.parseInt(x) + 2;
    //"Integer.parseInt converts something to an integer, in this case a string it turned into an integer//
    //"Short.parseShort" converts something to a short// 
    //"Float.parseFloat" converts something to a float//
