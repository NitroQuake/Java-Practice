Strings are used for data values that are made up of ordered sequences of characters

Strings:

String message = "    Hello World" + "!!";
        System.out.println(message.trim());
        //"endsWith(!!)" tells if the string has "!!" at the end of the message//
        //"startsWith(H)" Tells if the string has "H" at the beginning of the message//
        //"length()" tells how many characters are there//
        //"indexOf(*)" tells where the letter first appears in the sentence//
        //"replace(*, *)" is where you choose a character (before the comma) and replace it with another character (after the comma)//
        //"toLowerCase()" lowercase's all the character//
        //"toUpperCase()" uppercase's all the character//
        //"trim()" get rids of the spaces//

Escape squences for messages:

String message = "c:\tWindows\\";
        //to quote a message in your text you must use "\"*\""//
        //to add a back slash to a messgae you must add another "\" to it"//
        //"\n" creates a new line//
        //"\t" adds a tab space//
