An arithmetic expression is an expressopn that reults in a numeric value.

Arithmetic expressions:

int x = 1 + 3;
     //"+" addition//
    //"-" subtractaction//
    //"*" multiplication//
    //"/" division if you put "(double)" before the numbers and replace "int' with "double"//

using arithmetic expressions to change integer variables:

int x = 1;
x += 2;
    //"+=" means adding when changing a variable//
    //"-=" means subtracting when changing a variable//
    //"*=" means multiplying when changing a variable//
    //"/=" means dividing when changing a variable//

PEMDAS:

int x = 10 + 3 * 2;
    //Values will be found using the oerder of operations (PEMDAS), x would be 16 in the problem above//

using arithmetic expressions to change multipe integer variables by one:

int x = 1;
int y = x++;
    //"x++" is an incrament. Basically what is happening above is x is being added by 1 due to "++" and the "x" before "++" will be copied to "y"//
    //"++x" is also an incrament. But when "x++" is being replaced by "++x" above both "x" and "y" will be added by 1//
